This software is a robot arena simulator consisting of an arena that contains
entities, some of which may be movable (such as the robots) and others which are
immovable (such as the Recharge Station and various obstacles). The robots in
this simulated arena have many of the properties that real robots do, including
physical properties such as velocity and collision, and also architectural
properties such as the need for a battery to operate and sensors in order to
gather intel about its surroundings (in this case, the primary sensor that the
robot uses is the touch/collision sensor). The arena takes advantage of
events/event listener objects to handle interaction between the various entities
within the arena. At the same time, the GraphicsArenaViewer is in charge of
handling all input from the viewer of the simulation, such as mouse and keyboard
input, as well as responsible for initiating the drawing of all the entities on
the screen.
