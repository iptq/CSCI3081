# Requirements Not Completed

- Did not complete sensor entity type, wasn't too clear on its purpose. It generates an event for it but the Robot doesn't do anything with it once the sensor is activated.
- Collision between robots stopped working last minute, I'm not really sure what happened. It only doesn't work when the robot has been frozen. Weird bugs.
