Question 1

The name of the paper is "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", and
it can be found at https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf.

Question 2

The purpose of the paper is to present a new system that uses cryptography to
verify the authenticity of monetary transfers. It introduces the concept of a
"blockchain".

Question 3

It seems that the intended audience of the paper is for cryptography enthusiasts
or certain people who may be willing to implement and adopt such a protocol. It
doesn't seem to be making any attempt to push this system as something that the
masses should adopt; he's simply presenting this as a method of making
verifiable and secure transfers.

Question 4

A. extremely important
B. useful but not critical
C. extremely important
D. useful but not critical
E. extremely important
F. useful but not critical
G. useful but not critical
H. useful but not critical
I. important if it's related to findings
J. useful but not critical
K. useful but not critical
L. not very important
M. not very important
N. not very important
O. useful but not critical

Question 5

The most successful element of the paper was the fact that he stated key
information clearly. As this is a paper related to a protocol, some of the most
important things that should be covered include the motivation behind certain
designs. This information is clearly presented, usually beginning with the
problem that the presented solution is intended to solve, and then the actual
solution.

Question 6

The least successful element of the paper was integrating tables, diagrams,
references into the text. Rather than using the diagrams effectively, the
diagrams seem to be added into the paper after it has been written; the paper
doesn't reference the images at all and there is an occasional caption to the
image that explains what it means.
