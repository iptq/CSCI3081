This example demonstrates bad design. There are many things wrong with respect to the design principles of
encapsulation, coupling, cohesion, and information hiding. The interface of the class, which is dictated

Can you identify some of the problems with this design? Think about our enemy _modification_, and where
in the code would modifications have a ripple effect that requires several changes in several places.
