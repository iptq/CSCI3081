### Project Regrade Requests
#### CSCI 3081W Staff Fall 2017

The window for regrade requests is **__10 calendar days__** after grades are released in
moodle (i.e. weekends count). To be considered, you must submit a formal request
based on the feedback file provided with specific examples,  as outlined below.
Requests in the form of "Please regrade my project, I think you made a mistake
or graded me unfairly," will not be considered.

- All regrade requests must be submitted in writing to
csci3081f17-help@umn.edu. Do not contact individual TAs or Prof. Larson with
regrade requests – they will be ignored.
- Please include _Regrade Request_ in the subject line.
- Please include a link to the home directory of your repo.
or to the specific directory of the code/documentation in consideration.
- Please include code files indicating the line numbers, screenshots, or some
other form of documentation.

Once we have regraded an assignment/project iteration, **we will not accept
additional regrade requests for that grade item**, and the updated grade will be
final. Please include ALL requests at one time.

When regrading any item, there is NO guarantee that your grade will go up. It
may go down if we find other issues we initially overlooked.

### Presenting Work for a Regrade

Requests in the form of "Please regrade my project, I think you made a mistake
or graded me unfairly," will not be considered.

Please include with the request the specific item on the feedback that you think
was graded incorrectly, along with specific information about why you think it
was graded incorrectly. This might include a screenshot, a file with indicated
line numbers, or directions on how to run the code to see exactly the functionality
in question.

_Example 1_: I did not receive any points for X because my code did Y, but that
was only under Z circumstances, and as you can see in the attached screenshots,
it performs correctly in the majority of cases, so I do not think I should lose
all the points for this item. And here is the link to my repo: W.

_Example 2_: I did not receive any points for X functionality, however that is
implemented in my code. **__Go to the attached file Y.cc and look at lines ##-##__** to see the corresponding code. And here is the link to my repo: Z.

_Example 3_: I did not receive any points for documentation of X – perhaps you did
not see it in the docs folder. It is titled Y: here is the link to the file in my repo.
