# Proof-of-Concept for the RobotSim project for 3081W

The base code for the robot simulator project of 3081W was bourn from this proof-of-concept application written by Dan Keefe. There are 2 primary components: the _robot\_viewer_ and _robot\_land_. Robots live in robot land and are quite oblivious to being viewed by the viewer. The viewer is in control of everything in that it sends a message to robot_land to update, meaning move the robots the appropriate amount given how much time has passed since the last update. It then gets the appropriate positional information from each robot and draws these to the screen. All the while, the system is listening for keyboard and mouse activity by the user. If any action occurs, the associated callback is executed.

After reading below and looking through the code, you might want to circle back to the explanation above to better understand how this works.

### libSimpleGraphics and /project/f17c3081

The robot viewer is a subclass of GraphicsApp, which can be found in the libSimpleGraphics repo. When building the simulator, the local object files are linked with libSimpleGraphics located at `/project/f17c3081`, which is publicly accessible on all cselabs machines. If you want to compile on your own platform, you will have to create a similar directory and change the makefile to reflect your local drive (i.e. edit the CS3081DIR variable in src/Makefile to point to the directory where libSimpleGraphics has been installed.)

> **Do not submit to your repo any of the code from libSimpleGraphics. Also, do not submit a makefile in which you are linking to your personal local directory - it must refer to the cselabs directory.**

### Directory Structure

Makefile:
- make all and make clean for the whole project (calls make recursively in subdirs).

src/:
- the main source code where you will find robot_viewer.h/cc and robot_land.h/cc

src/Makefile:
- builds the project source, assumes it should build all .cc and .cpp files in the current directory
- **creates an executable in build/bin/exename**
- uses auto dependency generation to get dependencies from #includes

build/:
- created by the Makefiles

build/bin:
- **all exes generated for the project go in here**

build/obj:
- all .o's and .d's (from make depend) go in here

## Getting Started

1. _pull_ the class repo.
2. cp the lab to your personal repo
3. If you are working from your local machine, modify the `CS3081DIR` variable in `src/Makefile` so that it points to your local installation of libSimpleGraphics. Ignore this step if working on a CSE labs machine.
4. At the top level from the OS command prompt: `make`
5. Navigate to `build/bin`
6. At command prompt: `./robotviewer`

If you have trouble compiling, it might be that your account is behind on the gcc version. At the prompt, type `gcc --version` and if it says 4.x, you need to load gcc: `module load /soft/gcc/7.1`.

## Code explanation

### class GraphicsApp

The GraphicsApp makes use of the nanogui, nanovg, and openGL libraries to create a window with 2D graphics and a GUI. As with most graphics applications, there is a main loop in which keyboard and mouse events are handled, then all objects in the graphics window are drawn. The loop is executed at the frame rate until the application is closed. The actual loop is hidden inside the library code, but it behaves something like this:

```C++
while (Active(window)) {  // ie user has not clicked 'x' to close the window
  handleKeyMouseEvents();
  clearScreen()   // start with a fresh screen/buffer
  drawContents();
  swapBuffers(window);    // double-buffered system
}
```

This loop is initiated by a call to nanogui::mainloop(), which you can find in GraphicsApp::Run().

```C++
void GraphicsApp::Run() {
  glfwSetTime(0.0);
  nanogui::mainloop();
}
```

Once that mainloop() is initiated, at the frame rate, GraphicsApp::draw() will be called. Notice the **two very important function calls `UpdateSimulation()` and `DrawUsingNanoVG()`**.

```C++
void GraphicsApp::draw(NVGcontext *ctx) {

  double now = glfwGetTime();
  UpdateSimulation(now - last_draw_time_);
  last_draw_time_ = now;

  // Draw the user interface using the nanogui library, which is built upon nanovg
  Screen::draw(ctx);

  // Draw other vector graphics using the nanovg library
  DrawUsingNanoVG(ctx);
}
```

### class RobotViewer in robot_viewer.h / .cc

RobotViewer is a subclass of GraphicsApp. In this application, it is instantiated in main() with the name _app_. Notice in the constructor of RobotViewer, you see the instantiation of robot land. The simulator gets started with a call to app->Run(), which calls nanogui::mainloop():

```C++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {

  csci3081::InitGraphics();

  csci3081::RobotViewer \*app = new csci3081::RobotViewer();
  app->Run();

  csci3081::ShutdownGraphics();
  return 0;
}
```

Recall that in the draw() function of the GraphicsApp, there is a call to UpdateSimulation() and DrawUsingNanoVG(). **Look at these function definitions in _robot\_viewer.cc._** All that is happening in Update is a call to robot land to update based on how much time has passed. In the draw function, each object of robot land is being drawn. Notice that the graphics commands for drawing each of the objects begins with `nvg` for nanovg. The header file `https://github.com/memononen/nanovg/blob/master/src/nanovg.h` is pretty well documented. Take a moment to look at this header file and read about some of the function calls that you see in drawing the various graphics objects (e.g. DrawRobot, DrawObstacle).

(The keyboard and mouse event processing is discussed below.)

### class RobotLand

Robot land has no awareness of robot viewer, despite the fact that it was instantiated inside of robot viewer. You can think about robots in robot land constantly moving around (even though they move in discrete steps), but periodically the robot viewer takes a snapshot of the situation and displays it on the screen. Robot viewer interacts with robot land through getters, which get information from each robot and each obstacle that is relevant to drawing them in the graphics window.

Currently, robot land consists of one stationary obstacle and two robots going around in circles. No robot class exists, but if it did, it would consist of a position, velocity, color, and size. The color and size is fixed. The position and velocity are determined by the circular pattern they are following. A call to circle_x() and circle_y() with a time value will generate the current position of the robot. Notice that the RobotLand::advance_time() sets the current time of the simulation. When the robot viewer needs to draw the objects, circle_x and circle_y are called to calculate and return the current position of the robot.

### Keyboard and Mouse Event Handling

Events are handled inside robot viewer, because this manages all aspects of the GUI. Look in robot_viewer.cc to see the various events to be handled (e.g. OnKeyDown(), which handles the down arrow key). The name gives an indication of which event it is responding to. When that event occurs, this is the function that is called. You never see the call to this function, but know that it does happen. Currently, for the most part, events are handled by printing messages to a terminal, but they really come in handy when you want the user to interact with the graphics window. For example, you might want the functionality that wherever the user clicks the mouse, a robot is created at that position.

The menu you see in the application with a reset and pause button was a custom menu made for this application. If you downloaded the nanogui examples, you saw how complex these menus can be. It is quite easy to add buttons with various functionality to the menu. Let's trace that process through the code ...

It starts in the RobotViewer constructor:

```C++
nanogui::FormHelper *gui = new nanogui::FormHelper(this);

nanogui::ref<nanogui::Window> window =
    gui->addWindow(Eigen::Vector2i(10, 10), "Simulation Controls");
pause_btn_ =
    gui->addButton("Pause", std::bind(&RobotViewer::OnPauseBtnPressed, this));
gui->addButton("Restart", std::bind(&RobotViewer::OnRestartBtnPressed, this));
```

You start with the instantiation of FormHelper, then add the various components. The parameters being passed to the `addButton` are the name that appears on the button and the _callback_ function, meaning the one that is called when the button is pressed (which is registered via a mouse click). Again, all of this is going on behind the scenes and you will not see an explicit call to the callback function.

Next, look at each of the functions passed to the "Restart" and "Pause" buttons:

```C++
void RobotViewer::OnRestartBtnPressed() {
  robot_land_->set_time(0.0); }

void RobotViewer::OnPauseBtnPressed() {
  paused_ = !paused_;
  if (paused_) {
    pause_btn_->setCaption("Play");
  } else {
    pause_btn_->setCaption("Pause");
  }
}
```

At this point, you should have a general understanding of the framework for the graphics application. If you are really not understanding it, read through again or talk to a peer.

## Your Assignment

1. Add a robot class to the application. Define the robot class in the 2 files _robot.h_ and _robot.cc_
    - Use the robot class to save the size, color, position, and velocity.
    - Instantiate 2 robots as members of the class RobotLand when RobotLand is instantiated (i.e. use composition).
    - Modify the position and velocity of each robot when time is advanced.
    - Create getters for the robot class, which will be called from the getters of RobotLand (which are called by RobotViewer).
    > RECOMMENDATION: Create your robot class and test its functionality before trying to incorporate it into the graphics application. To test your robot class, create an instance of the class then use setters and getters to check that the member variables and methods are working properly. You can instantiate your robot temporarily in main(), commenting out the graphics. Then **gradually** incorporate the functionality of the robot class into the graphics.

2. Add a button to the GUI to change the color of a robot - either robot.
    - Create an OnColorChangeBtnPressed() function that changes a robot color.
    - Instantiate the button in the RobotViewer constructor, passing it the function name.

3. If you get this far, do something for fun! Maybe you want to ...
    - Add a different kind of object.
    - Move the robot in a different pattern.
    - Have the robot bounce off of other objects.
    - Add more functionality to the GUI by adding more buttons.

4. And if you get this far, use cpplint to see if it is Google Style Guide compliant:
      `cpplint --repository=. robot_land.cc`
