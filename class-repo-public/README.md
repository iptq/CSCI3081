# class-repo-public for CSCI3081 Fall 2017

This is a read-only repository. Students copy from this into their personal repo in the course organization.

There is a second branch _iter1-update1_ whose source code is functionally equivalent to the master branch but
is refactored. At the start of iteration2, these branches will be merged. Students will receive instructions on 
refactoring so that student repos are aligned with class-repo-public.
